# Agripay
Agripay is a simple Django-based marketplace that connects farmers with buyers. Farmers can create profiles, add products, and manage their listings, while buyers browse available farm goods through a clean marketplace interface. The platform includes authentication, product CRUD operations, and a user-friendly dashboard for farmers.
